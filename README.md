Learning Journal

What I have learned today in 102d7. 
We started off with an introduction session so I learned a bit about the people around me. 
I also learned a bit about the learning speace when I got a tour.
I learned some about slack, canvas and github. 
I learned about different learning styles and different mindsets as they relate to learning. I learned that there are different types of learning and that everyone has different strengths.
