CSS makes webpages more attractive and engaging to the reader. One goal of using CSS is to create a page that the reader will want to spend time viewing. CSS uses many rules that can be placed within HTML pages and you can use CSS to modify specific sections and text of HTML documents. CSS can be very specific and that allows the option of more detail in the webpage. You also can create a CSS external style sheet so that you can create all of the web pages you want to with the same or very similar style. There are many color options to choose from when you use CSS. You can select colors using rgb values, hex codes, color names and HSLA.
