##what I learned today

I learned about some of the the functions of GIT and GIThub and why it exists. Git is an awesome version control system. It allows users to see all changes in a file over time. This is *important for several reasons*.... one of them is that a person may want to track their changes over time so that they may see the piece of code that made a **specific change** in the final piece/project. 
People can also **collaborate** from different parts of the world (or sitting next to each other) on coding with Github. Github is the place where people do the work and then the work is stored in the cloud. I also learned how to search files in my computer using ubuntu.I am quite enjoying this learning.
