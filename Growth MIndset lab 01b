Growth Mindset
Growth mindset a way of looking at and reflecting our reactions to learning, growth and change. The growth mindset embraces and encourages:
Persisting despite challenges
Challenging oneself to be better
Reflecting on your day and experiences and considering what you did well and what could have done better. 
Remembering that the success of others will make your team stronger and better. Doing what you can to promote others success. 

3 reminders of how I plan to keep myself in the growth mindset:
1.	Moving forward even when I feel that I havenâ€™t accomplished everything that I intended to. 
2.	Reflecting daily on what I did well and what and how I could have done better
3.	Challenging myself daily. 
4.	Encouraging success in my teammates.
